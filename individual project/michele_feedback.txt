I really liked the idea for your project, and I am really glad that you read a bunch of TinyWebDB tutorials to try and make the project happen. Unfortunately, the fact that you were not able to connect the phone to your computer showed in your app - I can’t play the game. The TinyWebDB is not a super-easy thing to get working, so I’m glad that you tried. 

Looking at your screenshots, my best guess as to the first thing that went wrong is that you are setting your variable button11click to True or False instead of to 1 like you think you are. To set the value of button11click to 1, all you need to do is set global button11click to number 1 (you don’t need the global button11click). This is definitely the start of your problems, since the rest of your code is based on this variable button11click. Unfortunately, I can’t play your game because there might be other problems with the app. 

I do like the design a lot - it is very easy to use and very clear what exactly I am supposed to do to play the game, so you don’t need any other instructions for the user. 

If you want to work on your app (me or Tal can help you) to finish it to a point where you are happy showing off this app, I am more than happy to help you continue this and find all the bugs. Great work so far on the app.
